# Python_Practice
Contains python codes that I wrote when learning to code.

These programs were written some time ago, and as I was in the learning process, the style is not uniform. It would not be a good use of my time currently to make the style uniform.

The code here is not too interesting for Python experts, but they are for my reference and could be a source of inspiration for beginners.

- Straight-forward code examples such as returning the mean, deciding whether a point is on a given line, testing primality, returning the smallest from a list, return a string in its proper case, check if two strings are anagrams, and many more...
- Determining Arithmetic or Geometric Seq for four numbers
- Consume two lists of integers of the same length: source, and maximums. Mutates source so that every number it contains is smaller than or equal to the number at the same index in maximums.
- Simple guessing game that consumes a hidden number and number of tries available, then interacts with the player by indicating whether their input is higher, lower, or correct (or game over if all lives lost).
