# Python_Practice
Contains python codes that I wrote when learning to code.

These programs were written some time ago, and as I was in the learning process, the style is not uniform. It would not be a good use of my time currently to make the style uniform.

The code here is not too interesting for Python experts, but they are for my reference and could be a source of inspiration for beginners.
