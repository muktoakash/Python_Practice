    "The codes included here comes from various problems that I solved when learning Python for the first time. Just like the codes in [\"Beginning Python\"](https://github.com/muktoakash/Python_Practice/blob/master/Beginning_Python.ipynb), these programs and functions are fairly straight-forward, and are uploaded here for my reference. Once again, there may be a bit of conflicting styles in the way the code is commented."
